# Analysis of DeFi Wallet Credit Scores

This document provides an analysis of the credit scores generated by the `score_wallets.py` script, which processes Aave V2 transaction data to assign a score between 0 and 1000 to each unique wallet.

**To reproduce this analysis, ensure you have run `score_wallets.py` first, which generates `wallet_scores.csv`.**

## 1. Score Distribution

The credit scores are distributed across the 0-1000 range. Understanding this distribution helps in identifying the general population's risk profile and the effectiveness of the scoring model in differentiating wallets.

Below is a textual representation of the score distribution across 100-point ranges.

```python

import pandas as pd
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import numpy as np

wallet_scores_df = pd.read_csv('wallet_scores.csv')


bins = list(range(0, 1001, 100))
labels = [f"{i}-{i+99}" for i in range(0, 1000, 100)]

wallet_scores_df['score_range'] = pd.cut(wallet_scores_df['credit_score'], bins=bins, labels=labels, right=False)


distribution = wallet_scores_df['score_range'].value_counts().sort_index()

print("Wallet Score Distribution:")
for label, count in distribution.items():
    percentage = (count / len(wallet_scores_df)) * 100
    print(f"{label}: {count} wallets ({percentage:.2f}%)")
