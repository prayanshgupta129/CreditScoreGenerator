# Analysis of DeFi Wallet Credit Scores

This document provides an analysis of the credit scores generated by the `score_wallets.py` script, which processes Aave V2 transaction data to assign a score between 0 and 1000 to each unique wallet.

**To reproduce this analysis, ensure you have run `score_wallets.py` first, which generates `wallet_scores.csv`.**

## 1. Score Distribution

The credit scores are distributed across the 0-1000 range. Understanding this distribution helps in identifying the general population's risk profile and the effectiveness of the scoring model in differentiating wallets.

Below is a textual representation of the score distribution across 100-point ranges.

```python
# Conceptual Python code to generate this distribution (assuming wallet_scores.csv exists)
import pandas as pd
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import numpy as np

# Load the generated scores
wallet_scores_df = pd.read_csv('wallet_scores.csv')

# Define score bins
bins = list(range(0, 1001, 100))
labels = [f"{i}-{i+99}" for i in range(0, 1000, 100)]

# Categorize scores into bins
wallet_scores_df['score_range'] = pd.cut(wallet_scores_df['credit_score'], bins=bins, labels=labels, right=False)

# Count wallets in each range
distribution = wallet_scores_df['score_range'].value_counts().sort_index()

print("Wallet Score Distribution:")
for label, count in distribution.items():
    percentage = (count / len(wallet_scores_df)) * 100
    print(f"{label}: {count} wallets ({percentage:.2f}%)")

# Example for plotting (requires matplotlib)
# plt.figure(figsize=(10, 6))
# distribution.plot(kind='bar')
# plt.title('Distribution of Wallet Credit Scores')
# plt.xlabel('Score Range')
# plt.ylabel('Number of Wallets')
# plt.xticks(rotation=45, ha='right')
# plt.tight_layout()
# plt.savefig('score_distribution.png')
# plt.show()
